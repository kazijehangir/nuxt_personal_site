## Traditional CMS site



### Wordpress

Issues:

- Heavy-weight website, didn't feel as modern even with nice themes.

- Version control was iffy, plain text files are better.

- Tried to optimise for hosting multiple Wordpress sites on a single VM
 installation, with a single database. This introduced so many issues especially
 when trying to move from self-hosted to a Google Cloud VM.

- 

## Static markdown blogging site

### Ghost
